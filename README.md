# gang-related
This is an analysis of three groupsâ€™ likelihoods to classify crimes as gang-related. These results are still in preparation, so the analyses shown here use synthetic data, and do not reflect any real-world patterns.

I first model how the number of gang-characteristics relates to each rating group's likelihood of labeling a crime as gang-related.
I also use these models to calculate each rating group's decision cut-points -- the number of characteristics for which their odds of classification pass the 50:50 mark.
I then model how each characteristic independently relates to each rater's classifications.
